Preface
=======

Welcome to *JavaScript for Python Programmers*. This short ebook is an ongoing
project to help Computer Science students who have had one or two
semesters of Python learn the JavaScript programming language. If you are not
a part of that audience you may still find this a useful way to learn
about JavaScript. This book is written using the **build on what you know**
philosophy. In order to help you learn JavaScript I will start with a Python
example and then implement the example in JavaScript. Along the way we will
examine the strengths, weaknesses and differences between those two
languages.

This book does not attempt to replace the many good JavaScript reference books
that are available.  Please feel free to use this book for
yourself, or if it fits a class you are teaching you are welcome to use
this as a resource for your own class.
